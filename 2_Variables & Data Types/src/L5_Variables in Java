2*(a+b) where a and b are variables
'2' is a literal, these are universal values
'a','b','@','*' are character literals

int a = 10; -> a is a variable, where value of 10 is assigned to variable 'a'
int b = 5;-> b is a variable, where value of 10 is assigned to variable 'b'

(a,b,c -> variables names
JavaBasics -> classes name
Functions like -> main,print,println)
These all are called identifiers
